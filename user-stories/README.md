# 📘 Airbnb Clone — User Stories (Backend)

This document captures the **user stories** derived from key use cases in the Airbnb Clone project.  
User stories represent what different **actors** (Guest, Host, Admin) want to achieve while interacting with the system.  

Understanding and implementing these stories helps guide development and ensures the backend aligns with real-world needs.
